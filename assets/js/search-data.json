    "title": "What is Machine Learning(ML)?",
    "content": "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. This is like teaching a computer how to think by showing it what to learn from. As you can imagine, computers improve their perfomance and reliability on performing a particular task through this exposure and training. For this to be achieved, we develop ML algorithms and models. This approach can be likened to the way humans learn through experience. ML Algorithms . A Machine Learning (ML) algorithm is a set of mathematical rules or procedures that a computer follows to learn patterns or insights from data. These algorithms process data, identify patterns, and use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. Classical machine learning uses a small number of algorithms in a relatively simple arrangement. Other classical learning algorithms are more complicated. For example, their result might be represented as a position on a multidimensional graph. Types of ML Algorithms . Machine Learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into three types: . | Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The algorithm learns to make predictions or decisions based on this input output pair. | Examples: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM). | . | Unsupervised Learning: Here the algorithm is given data without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The goal is to find hidden patterns or structures in the input data. This is usually achieved by grouping, compressing, or organizing it into meaningful ways . | Examples: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA). | . | Reinforcement Learning: In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and uses this feedback to make better decisions over time. | Examples: Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). | . | . Each type of algorithm is suited to different kinds of tasks and has its own strengths and weaknesses. In future posts we will look at some of these algorithms and craft lab examples to see how they work. ML Models . A Machine Learning (ML) model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process. This is so because it is created by training an algorithm on a dataset, allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data. Once trained, the model can make predictions or decisions on new unseen data. Components of a ML Model . | Input Data: This is data used to train the model. This can include various features or attributes that are relevant to the task at hand. | Algorithm: The method or procedure used to train the model. Usually different algorithms are suited to different types of tasks and data. | Parameters: These internal variables of the model that are adjusted during training to minimize errors and improve the model accuracy. | Output: The predictions or decisions made by the model based on the input data. | . Training a ML Model . Training a ML model involves feeding it input data and adjusting its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes. This process is typically iterative, with the model being evaluated and refined over multiple cycles. Evaluating a ML Model . Once trained, a ML model is evaluated using a separate dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. The choice usually depends on the specific task and type of model. In future posts, we will delve deeper into the process of training and evaluating ML models and explore various techniques to improve their performance. Stay Connected .

    "content": "Artificial intelligence refers to the ability of a machine being able to learn patterns on data and make predictions. This approach helps to add value to human judgment. AI plays a pivotal role in our lives, powering Search engines, recommendation systems, speech recognition system and many more. As computing power and algorithms become more powerful and the increase in data volumes, companies will continue to adopt new use cases for AI technologies. Companies are embeding smart systems into their applications to drive innovation and efficiencies, enhancing employee experience, automate tasks, decrease costs and improve revenue. Artificial intelligence machines don’t actually think but rather, they analyze data to make predictions which gives an illusion of the systems having the ability to think like a human. But how does an AI system work? It does 2 imprtant things; . | Data Collection and Analysis: AI systems gather enormous amount of data from various sources, This data is then cleaned, transformed and organized in ways that would have been considered impossible only a few years ago. | Prediction: AI services can then use their data analysis to make predictions. They in effect say, “Based on this information, a certain thing will probably happen”. This approach may not seem like much, but that analysis and those predictions can have an enormous impact. The Predictions aren’t always accurate. But if they’re correct more often than not, then they are very useful. | . AI Use cases . AI systems can be found in various systems and applications. Some common use cases include: . | Natural Language Processing: Online chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) to analyze (poorly) typed or spoken questions, then predict which answers to give on a wide range of topics such as shipping, business, weather, merchandise and so on. | Vision Recognition: AI helps doctors identify serious diseases based on unusual symptoms and early warning signs and it reads speed limit and stop signs as it guides cars through traffic. | Fraud Detection: AI analyzes patterns created when thousands of bank customers make credit card purchases, then predicts which charges might be the result of identity theft. | . These are just a few examples that illustrate the versatility and impact of AI across different sectors. Evolution of AI . AI systems can be categorized into three levels based on its capabilities: . | Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): Also known as Narrow AI or Weak AI. It’s focused on addressing a single task such as facial recognition, recommendation systems. They usually operates under a limited set of constraints and they do not possess general intelligence or consciousness. | Broad AI: This is a midpoint between Narrow and General AI. Rather than being limited to a single task, Broad AI systems are more versatile and can handle a wider range of related tasks. It is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business and enterprise specific knowledge and data to train the system. Newer Broad AI systems can predict global weather, trace pandemics and help businesses predict future trends. | Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Also known as General AI or Strong AI.This refers to a machine that has the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to a human being. AGI remains a theoretical concept and has not yet been achieved. | . There might be another level, known as artificial superintelligence (ASI) that could appear near the end of this century as scientist predict. In this level machines might become self aware, surpassing human intelligence and capabilities. It is an advanced form of AI that can outperform humans in every aspect, including creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. ASI is purely speculative at this stage and raises significant ethical and existential concerns. ",
